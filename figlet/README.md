# [Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters](#frank-ian-and-glens-letters)

[FIGlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIGlet), named after [Frank, Ian,
and Glen’s letters](http://www.figlet.org/faq.html), is a program from
the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of
[ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art):

``` highlight
 _ _ _          _   _     _
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
```

Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at
[figlet.org/examples.html](http://www.figlet.org/examples.html).

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called
[pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/).

In a file called `figlet.py`, implement a program that:

- Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
  - Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
  - Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in
    which case the first of the two should be `-f` or `--font`, and the
    second of the two should be the name of the font.
- Prompts the user for a `str` of text.
- Outputs that text in the desired font.

If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not
`-f` or `--font` or the second is not the name of a font, the program
should exit via `sys.exit` with an error message.

Hints

- You can install `pyfiglet` with:
  ``` highlight
  pip install pyfiglet
  ```

- The documentation for pyfiglet isn’t very clear, but you can use the
  module as follows:

  ``` highlight
  from pyfiglet import Figlet

  figlet = Figlet()
  ```

  You can then get a `list` of available fonts with code like this:

  ``` highlight
  figlet.getFonts()
  ```

  You can set the font with code like this, wherein `f` is the font’s
  name as a `str`:

  ``` highlight
  figlet.setFont(font=f)
  ```

  And you can output text in that font with code like this, wherein `s`
  is that text as a `str`:

  ``` highlight
  print(figlet.renderText(s))
  ```

- Note that the `random` module comes with quite a few functions, per
  [docs.python.org/3/library/random.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html).

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/6/figlet.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `figlet.zip` in
    your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget`
    and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip figlet.zip` to create a folder called `figlet`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute `rm figlet.zip`
    and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python figlet.py test`. Your program should
  exit via `sys.exit` and print an error message:
  ``` highlight
  Invalid usage
  ```
- Run your program with `python figlet.py -a slant`. Your program should
  exit via `sys.exit` and print an error message:
  ``` highlight
  Invalid usage
  ```
- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f invalid_font`. Your program
  should exit via `sys.exit` and print an error message:
  ``` highlight
  Invalid usage
  ```
- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f slant`. Type `CS50`. Your
  program should print the following:
  ``` highlight
     ___________ __________
  / ____/ ___// ____/ __ \
  / /    \__ \/___ \/ / / /
  / /___ ___/ /___/ / /_/ /
  \____//____/_____/\____/
  ```
- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f rectangles`. Type
  `Hello, world`. Your program should print the following:
  ``` highlight
   _____     _ _                        _   _
  |  |  |___| | |___      _ _ _ ___ ___| |_| |
  |     | -_| | | . |_   | | | | . |  _| | . |
  |__|__|___|_|_|___| |  |_____|___|_| |_|___|
    |_|
  ```
- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f alphabet`. Type `Moo`. Your
  program should print the following:
  ``` highlight
  M   M
  MM MM
  M M M ooo ooo
  M   M o o o o
  M   M ooo ooo
  ```

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/figlet
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit! This is a practice problem.
