1. Check if the program was called with 2 command-line arguments.
2. If the argument count is not 2, print an error message ("Usage: program_name key") and exit with an error code (1).
3. Get the second command-line argument (argv[1]) and store it as a string.
4. Loop through each character in the argument:
   - If it's not a digit, print an error message ("Usage: program_name key") and exit with an error code (1).
5. Convert the string argument to an integer (the key).

7. Prompt the user to enter plaintext.

8. Initialize an empty string to store the ciphertext.

9. Loop through each character in the plaintext:
   a. If the character is a letter:
      i. Determine if it's uppercase or lowercase.
      ii. Shift the letter in the alphabet by the key value (Caesar cipher).
      iii. Ensure the result wraps around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., 'z' + 1 becomes 'a').
      iv. Append the encrypted character to the ciphertext.
   b. If the character is not a letter, append it unchanged to the ciphertext.

10. Print the ciphertext.
