1. Check if the program was called with 2 command-line arguments.
2. If the argument count is not 2, print an error message ("Usage: program_name key") and exit with an error code 1.
3. Store the second command-line argument as a string.
4. Loop through each character in the argument:
   - If it's not a digit, print an error message ("Usage: program_name key") and exit with an error code (1).
5. Convert the string argument to an integer.
6. Prompt the user to enter plaintext.
7. Display "ciphertext: ".
8. Initialize variables rotated_char to store the inputted plaintext.
9. Loop through each character in the plaintext:
   - If the character is a letter:
      * Determine if it's uppercase or lowercase and shift the letter in the alphabet by the value accordingly.
      * Append the encrypted character to rotated_char.
   - Else, (the character is not a letter) do nothing.
10. Print the ciphertext.
