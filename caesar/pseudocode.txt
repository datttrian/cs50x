1. Check if the program was called with 2 command-line arguments.
   - If the argument count is not 2, print an error message ("Usage: program_name key")
   - Exit with an error code (1).
2. Store the second command-line argument as a string.
3. Loop through each character in the argument string:
   - If it's not a digit:
      * print an error message ("Usage: program_name key").
      * exit with an error code (1).
4. Convert the string argument to integer.
5. Display "plaintext: " to prompt the user input a string and store it in plaintext.
6. Display "ciphertext: ".
7. Loop through each character in the plaintext:
   - Initialize variables rotated_char to store the character
   - If the character is a letter:
      * Determine the base character based on the case of it.
      * Update the rotated character using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
   - Else, do nothing.
   - Print the ciphertext.
