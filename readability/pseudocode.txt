1. Prompt the user to input a text string and store it in the 'text' variable.
2. Count the number of letters in the 'text':
   a. Initialize a counter 'letters_count' to 0.
   b. Loop through each character in 'text':
      i. Check if the character is alphabetic (using 'isalpha' function).
      ii. If it's alphabetic, increment 'letters_count' by 1.
3. Count the number of words in the 'text':
   a. Initialize a counter 'words_count' to 1 (assuming the last word doesn't end with a space).
   b. Loop through each character in 'text':
      i. Check if the character is a whitespace character (using 'isspace' function).
      ii. If it's a whitespace character, increment 'words_count' by 1.
4. Count the number of sentences in the 'text':
   a. Initialize a counter 'sentences_count' to 0.
   b. Loop through each character in 'text':
      i. Check for sentence-ending punctuation marks (., !, ?).
      ii. If such a punctuation mark is found, increment 'sentences_count' by 1.
5. Calculate the Coleman-Liau index (CLI):
   a. Calculate the average number of letters per 100 words (L):
      i. L = (letters_count / words_count) * 100
   b. Calculate the average number of sentences per 100 words (S):
      i. S = (sentences_count / words_count) * 100
   c. Calculate the CLI using the formula:
      i. index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
6. Determine the reading level based on the CLI:
   a. If the index is greater than 16, print "Grade 16+".
   b. If the index is less than 1, print "Before Grade 1".
   c. Otherwise, print "Grade X" where X is the integer value of the index.
