1. Prompt the user to input a text string and store it in the 'text' variable.
2. Function count_letters(text):
   - Initialize a counter 'count' to 0.
   - For each character 'char' in 'text':
      - If 'char' is alphabetic:
         - Increment 'count' by 1.
   - Return 'count'.
2. Write a function to count the number of words in a text:
   - Initialize a counter 'count' to '1' to account for the first word.
   - Loop through each character in 'text':
      * If it's a whitespace, increment 'count' by '1'.
      * Else, do nothing
3. Write a function to count the number of sentences in a text:
   - Initialize a counter 'count' to '0'.
   - Loop through each character in 'text':
      * If it's a punctuation (., !, ?), increment 'count' by '1'.
      * Else, do nothing
4. Count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the input text using 3 previous functions
5. Calculate the Coleman-Liau index (CLI):
   - Calculate the average number of letters per 100 words (L):
   - Calculate the average number of sentences per 100 words (S):
   - Calculate the index using the formula: index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
6. Determine the reading level based on the CLI:
   - If the index is greater than 16, print "Grade 16+\n".
   - If the index is less than 1, print "Before Grade 1\n".
   - Otherwise, print "Grade X\n" where X is the integer value of the index.
