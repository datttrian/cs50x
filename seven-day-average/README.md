## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Work with live data
- Get practice with CSV files and `csv.DictReader`
- Practice using dictionaries, lists and exceptions

## [Background](#background)

A popular way to track COVID cases is using a 7-day average. Some states
only record cases once a week, so using a 7-day average is much more
accurate than daily numbers. In this program, you will be using a [New
York Times repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) of
live, cumulative COVID data to calculate new daily cases, create a 7-day
average, and compare this week’s average to the previous week.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute
    `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/6/seven-day-average.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called
    `seven-day-average.zip` in your codespace. Take care not to overlook
    the space between `wget` and the following URL, or any other
    character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip seven-day-average.zip` to create a folder called
    `seven-day-average`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute
    `rm seven-day-average.zip` and respond with “y” followed by Enter at
    the prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

The distribution code for this problem uses the python `requests`
library to access the New York Times data stored in an accessible GitHub
repository. This is stored as a CSV file. The program then uses
`DictReader` to read the CSV file. It then creates a `states` list to
use selected states for calculations.

You will be completing two functions, `calculate` and
`comparative_averages`.

### [`calculate`](#calculate)

In `calculate`, you’ll be creating a dictionary, `new_cases`, which will
keep track of 14 days of new COVID cases for each state. Keys in this
`dict` will be the names of states, and the values for each of those
keys will be the most recent 14 days of new cases. Since the data from
the New York Times is cumulative, each day’s new cases must be
calculated by subtracting the previous day’s cases. To do this, you may
want to create a second dictionary, `previous_cases`, that keeps track
of each day’s new cases as it’s calculated.

- Hint
  - You can store 14 values in the list for each state by appending each
    new day’s data to end of the list and when the length of the list is
    greater than 14, removing the first element from the list.

Your `calculate` function should ultimately return the `new_cases`
dictionary.

### [`comparative_averages`](#comparative_averages)

Since your `new_cases` dictionary is passed to this function, you can
calculate this week’s 7-day average by summing up the *last* 7 elements
in the list for a selected state, then dividing this by 7. You can
create a 7-day average for the previous week by doing the same with the
*first* 7 elements in that same list.

- Hint
  - Check out python list slicing to easily access a range of elements
    in a list. For example, `values[3:5]` will return the 3rd through
    4th indexed elements in the list `values`. Note that the second
    index is *not* inclusive.

You can then calculate the percent increase or decrease, by taking the
difference of the two 7-day averages and dividing by last week’s
average.

- Hint

  - Note that you can detect division by zero by handling a
    `ZeroDivisionError` with a `try` and `except` block. For example:

  ``` highlight
  try:
  numerator / denominator
  except ZeroDivisionError:
  ...
  ```

  [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/3/) for more on
  exceptions in Python.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

Why do you think some websites, such as [The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US)
post different values than your program generates for “Average daily new
cases” and “Change in avg. daily cases in last 7 days” for some states,
and the same values for others?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples below.

``` highlight
seven-day-average/ $ python seven-day-average.py
Choose one or more states to view average COVID cases.
Press enter when done.

State: Massachusetts
State: New York
State:

Seven-Day Averages
Massachusetts had a 7-day average of 1646 and an increase of 46%.
New York had a 7-day average of 7502 and a decrease of 1%.
```

``` highlight
seven-day-average/ $ python seven-day-average.py
Choose one or more states to view average COVID cases.
Press enter when done.

State: Maine
State: California
State:

Seven-Day Averages
California had a 7-day average of 20461 and a decrease of 8%.
Maine had a 7-day average of 196 and a decrease of 10%.
```

Do note that the numbers will vary each day, since the data you are
using is updated daily.
