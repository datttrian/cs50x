# [Snackbar](#snackbar)

## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Practice using `struct`s
- Write a linear search algorithm

## [Background](#background)

Imagine you’re at the beach and want to order a number of items from the
snack bar. You have a limited amount of cash on you, and you want to get
a total cost for your items before ordering. In `snackbar.c` you will
complete two functions. First is `add_items` which will add at least the
first 4 items on the Beach Burger Shack menu. Then you will complete
`get_cost` which will implement a linear search algorithm to search for
each item you choose, and return the corresponding price.

- Hints
  - You can hard code the menu items and prices in the `add_items`
    function.
  - There is a function in
    [`strings.h`](https://manual.cs50.io/#strings.h) that may come in
    handy here.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/3/snackbar.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `snackbar.zip`
    in your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between
    `wget` and the following URL, or any other character for that
    matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip snackbar.zip` to create a folder called
    `snackbar`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute
    `rm snackbar.zip` and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the
    prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

The `main` function is already complete. After calling `add_items` to
initialize the `menu` array, it will print out the menu items and their
prices, prompting you to keep selecting items until you press enter
without typing anything in. You are to complete two functions,
`add_items`, which adds at least the first four menu items, and
`get_cost` to return the cost of each item. When you are creating a
linear search algorithm in `get_cost`, do make sure that it is case
insentive.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

- Why is an array of `struct`s a better solution here than multiple
  arrays?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave as follows:

``` highlight
snackbar/ $ ./snackbar

Welcome to Beach Burger Shack!
Choose from the following menu to order. Press enter when done.

Burger: $9.50
Vegan Burger: $11.00
Hot Dog: $5.00
Cheese Dog: $7.00
Fries: $5.00
Cheese Fries: $6.00
Cold Pressed Juice: $7.00
Cold Brew: $3.00
Water: $2.00
Soda: $2.00

Enter a food item: burger
Enter a food item: fries
Enter a food item: soda
Enter a food item:

Your total cost is: $16.50
```

``` highlight
snackbar/ $ ./snackbar

Welcome to Beach Burger Shack!
Choose from the following menu to order. Press enter when done.

Burger: $9.50
Vegan Burger: $11.00
Hot Dog: $5.00
Cheese Dog: $7.00
Fries: $5.00
Cheese Fries: $6.00
Cold Pressed Juice: $7.00
Cold Brew: $3.00
Water: $2.00
Soda: $2.00

Enter a food item: cold brew
Enter a food item: hot dog
Enter a food item:

Your total cost is: $8.00
```

*Note that the menu should only print out the items that you saved in
the `menu` array.*

No `check50` for this one!

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the
`$` prompt.

``` highlight
style50 snackbar.c
```
