# [Hours](#hours)

## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Practice using arrays
- Using an array as a parameter to a function
- Adding values in a loop
- Integer division and type casting

## [Background](#background)

Suppose you’re taking CS50 (if you’re reading this you probably are!)
and spending time every week on each problem set. You may be wondering
how many hours you’ve spent learning computer science, on average or in
total! In this program, you’ll complete a function that calculates,
based on a user’s input, a total number of hours *or* an average number
of hours across a given number of days.

- Hints
  - To add up numbers in an array, you might first want to initialize a
    variable to zero. After, you’ll want to use a loop that adds each
    value in the array to that variable.
  - Be sure to pay attention to what happens if you divide two `int`s
    when calculating the average!

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  At the `$` prompt, type `mkdir hours`
4.  Now execute `cd hours`
5.  Then copy and paste
    `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/2/hours.c` into your
    terminal to download this lab’s distribution code.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

The `main` function prompts the user for the number of weeks a user has
been taking CS50, then creates an array with as many elements. Notice
that, after retrieving some data, the program prompts the user to type
in either “T” or “A”—”T” should (but doesn’t yet!) print the total
number of hours the user entered, while “A” should (but doesn’t yet!)
print the average hours the user entered. Notice that the `do while`
loop uses `toupper` to capitalize the letter that’s input before it is
saved in the variable `output`. Then, the `printf` function calls
`calc_hours`. Note the syntax involved when passing an array to a
function.

To complete `calc_hours`, first total up the hours saved in the array
into a new variable. Then, depending on the value of `output`, return
either this sum, or the average number of hours.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

- What is the advantage of using a function to calculate hours?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples below.

``` highlight
hours/ $ ./hours
Number of weeks taking CS50: 3
Week 0 HW Hours: 3
Week 1 HW Hours: 7
Week 2 HW Hours: 10
Enter T for total hours, A for average hours per week: A
6.7 hours
```

``` highlight
hours/ $ ./hours
Number of weeks taking CS50: 2
Week 0 HW Hours: 2
Week 1 HW Hours: 8
Enter T for total hours, A for average hours per week: T
10.0 hours
```

You can check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to
test your code when you submit, by typing in the following at the `$`
prompt. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/labs/2023/x/hours
```

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the
`$` prompt.

``` highlight
style50 hours.c
```

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit! This is an optional practice problem completed with
your lab.
