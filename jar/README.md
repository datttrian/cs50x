# [Cookie Jar](#cookie-jar)

Source: Sesame Street

Suppose that you’d like to implement a [cookie
jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_jar) in which to store
cookies. In a file called `jar.py`, implement a `class` called `Jar`
with these methods:

- `__init__` should initialize a cookie jar with the given `capacity`,
  which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the
  cookie jar. If `capacity` is not a non-negative `int`, though,
  `__init__` should instead raise a `ValueError` (via
  `raise ValueError`).
- `__str__` should return a `str` with $n$
  ![`🍪`](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png), where
  $n$ is the number of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there
  are 3 cookies in the cookie jar, then `str` should return
  `"`![`🍪`](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png)![`🍪`](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png)![`🍪`](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png)`"`
- `deposit` should add `n` cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that
  many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, `deposit` should
  instead raise a `ValueError`.
- `withdraw` should remove `n` cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom.
  If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though,
  `withdraw` should instead raise a `ValueError`.
- `capacity` should return the cookie jar’s capacity.
- `size` should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar.

Structure your `class` per the below. You may not alter these methods’
parameters, but you may add your own methods.

``` highlight
class Jar:
def __init__(self, capacity=12):
...

def __str__(self):
...

def deposit(self, n):
...

def withdraw(self, n):
...

@property
def capacity(self):
...

@property
def size(self):
...
```

## [Demo](#demo)

You’re welcome, but not required, to implement a `main` function in
which to test your class, so this is all we can demo!

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/6/jar.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `jar.zip` in
    your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget`
    and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip jar.zip` to create a folder called `jar`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute `rm jar.zip` and
    respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Define a `main` function in your `jar.py` file, wherein you create a
  new instance of `Jar` with `jar = Jar()`. Test this `jar` has the
  capacity it should by calling `print(str(jar.capacity))`. Be sure your
  program calls `main` at the bottom of the file, as via `main()`.
- Test that your `__str__` function works as intended by calling
  `print(str(jar))`.
- Try calling `jar.deposit(2)` to deposit two cookies. Calling
  `print(str(jar))` should now show you the same number of cookies
  you’ve deposited.
- Try calling `jar.withdraw(1)` to withdraw one cookie. Calling
  `print(str(jar))` should now show you one fewer cookie than you had
  before.
- Try experimenting with depositing and withdrawing various amounts of
  cookies. Are you unable to withdraw past the jar’s size? Are you
  unable to deposit past the jar’s capacity?

No `check50` for this one!
