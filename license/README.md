## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Practice working with files and file pointers
- More work with strings and arrays
- Debugging with `debug50`
- Use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks

## [Background](#background)

Suppose you work for a company that develops AI-enhanced license plate
recognition technology. As you develop your technology, you may want to
use actual license plate numbers as test data. You have a text file with
some plate numbers you want to analyze, so you first try reading from
that text file and printing out the license plates, to test your
file-reading logic. But when you run your program, only the last number
prints 8 times! What went wrong?

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/4/license.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `license.zip` in
    your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget`
    and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip license.zip` to create a folder called `license`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute `rm license.zip`
    and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

If you open the `plates.txt` file, you’ll notice that there are actually
8 different license plate numbers. There are a few errors in the
distribution code that are causing this to happen. Let’s start by
walking through the code.

We first check for command-line arguments, since `argv[1]` should be the
text file that contains the license plates. We then create a character
array of length 7, since the plate numbers are 6 `char`s long and we
need to save space for the NUL terminator. Now we create an array of
`char *`’s (character pointers, otherwise known as `string`s!) to store
the 8 plate numbers. We create a file pointer to our external text file,
create a variable to hold the index of each array element, and begin
reading the file and saving the plate numbers to the array. Finally, to
test that we did this correctly, we print out the values in the array.

However, when we compile and execute this code, something is clearly
wrong. You’ll need to make the appropriate corrections!

### [Debugging](#debugging)

Take a close look at what values are actually being added to the array.
You can experiment with `debug50` to find the error in the distribution
code.

- Hints
  - What exactly does the variable `buffer` hold that’s being assigned
    to each element of the `plates` array?
  - Note that the `plates` array as an array of `char *`’s or string
    pointers.
  - So when we assign the char array `buffer` to a `char *`, what
    actually happens?

Is there a better way to copy license plate numbers to the `license`
array?

- More Hints
  - Would `strcpy` come in useful here?
  - If you copy data to a pointer, where will that data go?
  - Is `malloc` required here?

### [Checking for Memory Leaks](#checking-for-memory-leaks)

Once your program seems to be working properly, run valgrind to make
sure there are no memory leaks.

``` highlight
valgrind ./license plates.txt
```

You may end up with something like this:

``` highlight
==24478== HEAP SUMMARY:
==24478==     in use at exit: 528 bytes in 9 blocks
==24478==   total heap usage: 10 allocs, 1 frees, 4,624 bytes allocated

==24478== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s

```

There seem to be two kinds of memory errors here that need to be
corrected!

- Hint
  - Your line numbers may be different, but note here that there seems
    to be a memory problem in `main` on line 30 (something to do with
    `malloc`?), and line 20 (a problem related to `fopen`?). What might
    the distribution code be missing?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples below.

``` highlight
license/ $ ./license plates.txt
11ZT00
1KAD21
78ZZ01
99ZZ11
72ZZ21
98ZZ31
44ZW41
34ZZ51
```

You can check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to
test your code when you submit, by typing in the following at the `$`
prompt. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/labs/2023/x/license
```

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the
`$` prompt.

``` highlight
style50 license.c
```

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit! This is a practice problem.
