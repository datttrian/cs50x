Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The predictions did not change significantly as the number of simulations increased. The order of the teams and their chances of winning remained relatively consistent

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The predictions stabilized after around 10,000 simulations. Beyond this point, the changes in predictions are minimal.
