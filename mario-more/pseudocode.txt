1. Define a function named 'repeat' that takes a character 'c' and an integer 'times':
   - While 'times' is greater than or equal to 0, display the character 'c' and decrement 'times' by 1
2. Repeat the following steps until n is between 1 and 8 (inclusive):
   - Display "Positive Number: " to the user
   - Input a positive integer and store it in n
3. For i from 1 to n (inclusive), do the following:
   - Call the 'repeat' function with parameters (' ', 'n - i') to print spaces before the hashes
   - Call the 'repeat' function with parameters ('#', 'i') to print the hashes
   - Display two spaces
   - Call the 'repeat' function with parameters ('#', 'i') to print the second set of hashes
   - Move to the next line
