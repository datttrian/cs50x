- Become aquainted with the history of web design
- Learn to use modern web development tools

## [Background](#background)

The world wide web as we know it has only been around since the mid
1990’s. Early tools to develop websites were very limited: there was no
CSS or JavaScript and HTML was rendered differently on different
browsers. One of the earliest sites was
[amazon.com](https://amazon.com).

Quite a different look than today!

Another early site was RadioShack. Their first website in 1996 had a
look very similar to websites of that time. The hottest design elements
were clunky-looking buttons and repeating background patterns.

A common feature on early sites was a link to a “text only” version of
the web page. Because internet connections were so slow, images could be
very slow to load! The oversized RadioShack logo and its corresponding
buttons are actually one image here: the buttons are activated using an
html `map` feature, which is still available today, but rarely used.

``` highlight
<map name="rsmap">
<area shape="rect" coords="8,246,122,297" href="http://www.radioshack.com/rsstorelocator/rszip?1">
<area shape="rect" coords="123,246,240,297" href="http://www.radioshack.com/rsfuture.html">
<area shape="rect" coords="241,246,358,297" href="http://www.tandy.com/contacts/">
<area shape="rect" coords="359,246,475,297" href="http://www.tandy.com/press.html">
<area shape="rect" coords="476,246,599,297" href="http://www.radioshack.com/history/">
</map>
```

There was very little control over typography and the only fonts
available were those that resided on a visitor’s computer. So a web
designer had to be careful to use only very common, standard fonts.

By 1997, RadioShack significantly upgraded the look of their site, and
it now looked like this. Note the 3-D spinning “R”, another popular
feature on websites of that time!

To create a layout like this with columns and rows, the entire page is
constructed from an HTML table, with a 1-by-1 pixel image,
`dot_clear.gif`, to control the visual layout of HTML elements on a web
page, since the HTML standard at the time did not allow this. Tables
were not created for this purpose, but designers had few options for
controling the layout of the page.

``` highlight
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="969"><tr valign="top" align="left">
	<td colspan="1" width="10"><img src="dot_clear.gif" width="10" height="1" border="0"></td>
	<td colspan="1" width="2"><img src="dot_clear.gif" width="2" height="1" border="0"></td>
	<td colspan="1" width="35"><img src="dot_clear.gif" width="35" height="1" border="0"></td
 ...
```

Since there was still limited choices for fonts, all of the type you see
on this page that is not the standard “Times Roman” was created as an
image and imported into the web page.

[Take a look at some other website designs from the
90’s.](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/10-90s-websites-designs-you-wont-believe-existed/)

Now you’ll re-design RadioShack’s website (just the homepage is fine!)
using modern web development tools. No tables, html maps or spinning
logos please!

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/8/redo.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `redo.zip` in
    your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget`
    and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip redo.zip` to create a folder called `redo`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute `rm redo.zip`
    and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

Notice that you’ve received three folders, `radio1996/`, `radio1997/`,
and `radiotoday/`. You can explore implementations of Radio Shack’s
website from 1996 and 1997, but you’ll ultimately create your own
iteration in `radiotoday/`.

One of the most popular front-end web development tools in use these
days is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/). It’s free,
open-source, and designed to enable responsive development of websites
and web apps. It’s built on top of CSS and JavaScript to allow
developers to create websites quickly and without having to recreate
commonly used features such as interactive buttons, navigation systems,
columns and grids.

Start your redesign by trying out bootstrap’s
[Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navbar/) feature
to easily create a custom navigation bar to handle all the menu options.
Scoll down on this bootstrap documentation until you see a simple
navigation bar with minimal code and copy this code to the top of the
`body` section of `index.html`.

``` highlight
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-light">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNavAltMarkup" aria-controls="navbarNavAltMarkup" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNavAltMarkup">
      <div class="navbar-nav">
        <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Home</a>
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
        <a class="nav-link disabled">Disabled</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
```

When you run `http-server` to preview your web page, you’ll see menu
items on top such as “Features”, “Pricing”, etc. Change these to
represent the appropriate menu items for your RadioShack homepage. You
don’t need to create additional pages for these to link to, but if you
did, you would change `href=#` in each of these menu items to link to
the appropriage html pages.

Next, take a look at other bootstrap features. Check out how to [create
columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/columns/) without
using tables as was done in the 90’s.

You may want to take a look at how to create [responsive
images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/images/) that shrink
and expand as the page size changes so they look good on any size
device.

And while you are thinking about images for your homepage, check out how
to create a
[carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/carousel/) to
automatically cycle through more than one image.

You are the designer, the design here is up to you. Have fun and see
what you can create! A more recent RadioShack logo is included if you
want to use it.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

- Why do you think so many designers use Bootstrap, rather than creating
  their own CSS?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

No `check50` for this assignment! To ensure that the code on your pages
is valid, you can use this [Markup Validation
Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), copying and
pasting your HTML directly into the provided text box.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit! This is practice problem.
