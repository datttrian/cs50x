- Become familiar with SQL
- Practice using `SELECT` and `UPDATE` operations

## [Background](#background)

In 2021’s Week 7 lecture, we created a SQL database, `favorites.db`,
with a table of CS50 students’ favorite TV shows. As often happens when
importing raw data, however, we have some inconsistencies and typos to
take care of (lest our queries become clumsy and our results
inaccurate!).

Your job is to use the SQL `UPDATE` keyword to clean up this database,
so it can be more effectively used for analysis.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/7/favorites.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `favorites.zip`
    in your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between
    `wget` and the following URL, or any other character for that
    matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip favorites.zip` to create a folder called
    `favorites`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute
    `rm favorites.zip` and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the
    prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

Let’s first take a look at the data. Recall that you’ll need to use
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), a lightweight “database
engine”, to open `favorites.db`. We’ll use the third (and latest)
version of SQLite. You can open `favorites.db`, then, by executing

``` highlight
sqlite3 favorites.db
```

so long as your terminal’s working directory is the same directory in
which `favorites.db` is located.

In your `sqlite3` prompt, try executing

``` highlight
.schema
```

to see the commands used to create the two tables in this database,
`shows` and `genres`.

Now try viewing the data inside of `shows` by executing

``` highlight
SELECT * FROM shows;
```

Scrolling up, notice that the very first title in `shows` already looks
like it might pose a problem. We want “How i met your mother” to be
title-cased! Let’s `UPDATE` this title by executing

``` highlight
UPDATE shows SET title = "How I Met Your Mother" WHERE title = "How i met your mother";
```

While you *could* retype each incorrectly entered show title, it’s much
more efficient to select muliple variations of the same show and
`UPDATE` these to the correct spelling. Maybe the `LIKE` keyword could
come in handy! There are many titles to clean up, including all of the
below:

- Adventure Time
- Arrow
- Avatar: The Last Airbender
- Brooklyn Nine-Nine
- Community
- Family Guy
- Friends
- Game of Thrones
- Gilmore Girls
- Grey’s Anatomy
- How I Met Your Mother
- It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
- Parks and Recreation
- Sherlock
- Squid Game
- The Bachelorette
- The Crown
- The Office
- The Queen’s Gambit
- The Untamed

If pressed for time, though, some of the more interesting clean-ups
involve these shows:

- Brooklyn Nine-Nine
- Game of Thrones
- Grey’s Anatomy
- It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
- Parks and Recreation
- The Office

Be sure to save each of these SQL statements to store in a new file
`favorites.sql`.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

- Why do you think it’s necessary to “clean” data when you can use the
  SQL `LIKE` statement?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Once you have completed all of your database `UPDATE`s, you may want to
`SELECT` all titles and list these alphabetically to make sure that all
are correct.

No `check50` for this one!

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit. This is a practice problem!
