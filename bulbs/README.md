## [Not-So-Broken Light Bulbs](#not-so-broken-light-bulbs)

In lecture, you may have noticed what seemed like a “bug” at the front
of the stage, whereby some of the bulbs always seem to be off:

Each sequence of bulbs, though, encodes a message in *binary*, the
language computers “speak.” Let’s write a program to make secret
messages of your own, perhaps that we could even put on stage!

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

Open [VS Code](https://cs50.dev/).

Start by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute `cd` by
itself. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below.

``` highlight
$
```

Click inside of that terminal window and then execute

``` highlight
wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/psets/2/bulbs.zip
```

followed by Enter in order to download a ZIP called `bulbs.zip` in your
codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget` and the
following URL, or any other character for that matter!

Now execute

``` highlight
unzip bulbs.zip
```

to create a folder called `bulbs`. You no longer need the ZIP file, so
you can execute

``` highlight
rm bulbs.zip
```

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP
file you downloaded.

Now type

``` highlight
cd bulbs
```

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory.
Your prompt should now resemble the below.

``` highlight
bulbs/ $
```

If all was successful, you should execute

``` highlight
ls
```

and see a file named `bulbs.c`. Executing `code bulbs.c` should open the
file where you will type your code for this problem set. If not, retrace
your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

To write our program, we’ll first need to think about **bases**.

### [The Basics](#the-basics)

The simplest *base* is base-1, or *unary*; to write a number, *N*, in
base-1, we would simply write *N* consecutive `1`s. So the number `4` in
base-1 would be written as `1111`, and the number `12` as
`111111111111`. Think of it like counting on your fingers or tallying up
a score with marks on a board.

You might see why base-1 isn’t used much nowadays. (The numbers get
rather long!) Instead, a common convention is base-10, or *decimal*. In
base-10, each *digit* is multiplied by some power of 10, in order to
represent larger numbers. For instance, $123$ is short for
$123 = 1 \cdot 10^{2} + 2 \cdot 10^{1} + 3 \cdot 10^{0}$.

Changing base is as simple as changing the $10$ above to a different
number. For instance, if you wrote `123` in base-4, the number you’d
really be writing is
$123 = 1 \cdot 4^{2} + 2 \cdot 4^{1} + 3 \cdot 4^{0}$, which is equal to
the decimal number $27$.

Computers, though, use base-2, or *binary*. In binary, writing `123`
would be a mistake, since binary numbers can only have `0`s and `1`s.
But the process of figuring out exactly what decimal number a binary
number stands for is exactly the same. For instance, the number `10101`
in base-2 represents
$1 \cdot 2^{4} + 0 \cdot 2^{3} + 1 \cdot 2^{2} + 0 \cdot 2^{1} + 1 \cdot 2^{0}$,
which is equal to the decimal number $21$.

### [Encoding a Message](#encoding-a-message)

Light bulbs can only be on or off. In other words, light bulbs represent
two possible states; either the bulb is on, or the bulb is off, just as
binary numbers are either 1 or 0. We’ll have to find a way to encode
text as a sequence of binary numbers.

Let’s write a program called `bulbs` that takes a message and converts
it to a set of bulbs that we could show to an unsuspecting audience.
We’ll do it in two steps:

- The first step consists of turning the text into decimal numbers.
  Let’s say we want to encode the message `HI!`. Luckily, we already
  have a convention in place for how to do this,
  [ASCII](https://asciitable.com/). Notice that `H` is represented by
  the decimal number `72`, `I` is represented by `73`, and `!` is
  represented by `33`.
- The next step involves taking our decimal numbers (like `72`, `73`,
  and `33`) and converting them into equivalent binary numbers, which
  only use 0s and 1s. For the sake of having a consistent number of bits
  in each of our binary numbers, assume that each decimal is represented
  with 8 bits. `72` is `01001000`, `73` is `01001001`, and `33` is
  `00100001`.

Lastly, we’ll interpret these binary numbers as instructions for the
light bulbs on stage; 0 is off, 1 is on. (You’ll find that `bulbs.c`
includes a `print_bulb` function that’s been implemented for you, which
takes in a `0` or `1` and outputs emoji representing light bulbs.)

Here’s an example of how the completed program might work. Unlike the
Sanders stage, we’ll print one byte per line for clarity.

``` highlight
# ./bulbs
Message: HI!


```

To check our work, we can read a bulb that’s on
(![🟡](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f7e1.png)) as a `1`
and bulb that’s off
(![⚫](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/26ab.png)) as a `0`.
Then `HI!` became

``` highlight
01001000
01001001
00100001
```

which is precisely what we’d expect.

Another example:

``` highlight
# ./bulbs
Message: HI MOM





```

Notice that all characters are included in the lightbulb instructions,
including nonalphabetical characters like spaces (`00100000`).

## [Specification](#specification)

Design and implement a program, `bulbs`, that converts text into
instructions for the strip of bulbs on CS50’s stage as follows:

- Implement your program in a file called `bulbs.c`.
- Your program must first ask the user for a message using `get_string`.
- Your program must then convert the given `string` into a series of
  8-bit binary numbers, one for each character of the string.
- You can use the provided `print_bulb` function to print a series of
  `0`s and `1`s as a series of yellow and black emoji, which represent
  on and off light bulbs.
- Each “byte” of 8 symbols should be printed on its own line when
  outputted; there should be a `\n` after the last “byte” of 8 symbols
  as well.

Hints for Decimal-to-Binary

Let’s walk through an example with the number 4. How would you convert 4
to binary? Start by considering the right-most bit, that which—if
on—adds 1 to the number we’re representing. Do you need this bit to be
on? Divide 4 by 2 to find out:

$$4/2 = 2$$

2 divides evenly into 4, which tells us there’s no remainder of 1 to
worry about. We can safely leave this right-most bit off, then:

``` highlight
0
```

What about the preceding bit, now, the one just the left of this bit we
discovered? To check, let’s follow a similar process, but pick up where
we left off. In the previous step, we divided 4 by 2 and got 2. Now,
does 2 divide evenly into 2? It does, so there’s no remainder of 2 to
worry about:

``` highlight
00
```

Let’s continue further still. After dividing 2 by 2, we’re left with 1.
Diving 1 by 2 leaves a remainder of 1. That means we’ll need to turn
this bit on:

``` highlight
100
```

And now that we’ve divided our number down to 0, we need no further bits
to represent it. Notice that we discovered the bits to represent 4 in
the opposite order in which we need to print them: we’ll likely need a
structure that lets us store these bits, so we can print them forwards
later on. And, of course, in your actual code, you’ll be working with
`char`s of 8 bits, so you’ll want to prepend any needed 0’s.

When checking for remainders, the modulo (`%`) operator may come in
handy! `4 % 2`, for example, returns 0, meaning that 2 divides into 4
with a remainder of 0.

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples above. You can check your
code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code
when you submit, by typing in the following at the `$` prompt. But be
sure to test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2023/x/bulbs
```

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the
`$` prompt.

``` highlight
