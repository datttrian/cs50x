sort1 uses: TODO Bubble Sort

How do you know?: TODO
reversed50,000.txt -> 5.756s
sorted50,000.txt -> 0.644s
For sorted files, sort1 was the fastest in sorting them.

sort2 uses: TODO Merge Sort

How do you know?: TODO
reversed50,000.txt -> 0.459s
For a reversed text file of 50,000 numbers, it was exponentially faster compared to the other sorting programs.

sort3 uses: TODO Selection Sort

How do you know?: TODO
reversed50,000.txt -> 4.021s
sorted50,000.txt -> 3.574s
It was the slowest sorting program in both a reversed number text file, as well as a sorted text file. Hence we can conclude that this is selection sort.
