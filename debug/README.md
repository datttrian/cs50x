## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Become familiar with C syntax
- Learn what C compiler error messages mean
- Get practice debugging

## [Background](#background)

There are two kinds of errors that can occur when writing a program. The
first errors you are likely to encounter are **syntactical** errors. In
addition to syntactical errors, there can also be logical errors, which
we’ll take a look at soon.

In computer science, syntax is important for a computer to understand
what you are telling it to do. Each programming language has its own
syntactical rules, which include the combination of both words and
punctuation.

This lab starts with distribution code which has several syntactical
errors. The idea is for you to try to compile (`make`) the program,
learn to interpret the rather cryptic error messages output by the
compiler, and **debug** the program.

- Hints
  - You’ll probably see the first error after trying to compile
    `debug.c` will be
    `debug.c:9:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'name'`. The `9`
    after `debug.c:` means there is a problem on line 9. Why do you
    think is says `undeclared identifier`?
  - You may want to look for errors such as missing symbols, missing
    libraries, missing variable declarations.
  - If you are still stuck, try typing into the terminal
    `help50 make debug`.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  At the `$` prompt, type `mkdir debug`
4.  Now execute `cd debug`
5.  Then copy and paste
    `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/1/debug.c` into your
    terminal to download this lab’s distribution code.
6.  Now try compiling this program, by typing `make debug` and see what
    happens!
7.  You most likely see an error that says:
    `debug.c:9:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'name'`
8.  This means there is an error that has something to do with an
    “undeclared identifier”, on line 9. Fix this bug, and then try to
    compile again. Keep in mind that debugging is an iterative process.
    You may need to fix an error, compile, then fix another error,
    compile again, multiple times!

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

- Why do you think C (as well as other programming languages) have such
  specific rules regarding syntax?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples below.

``` highlight
debug/ $ ./debug
What is your name? Carter
Where do you live? Cambridge
Hello, Carter, from Cambridge!
```

``` highlight
debug/ $ ./debug
What is your name? Margaret
Where do you live? New York
Hello, Margaret, from New York!
```

You can check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to
test your code when you submit, by typing in the following at the \$
prompt. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/labs/2023/x/debug
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

To evaluate that the style of your code (indentations and spacing) is
correct, type in the following at the `$` prompt.

``` highlight
style50 debug.c
```

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit! This is an optional practice problem.
