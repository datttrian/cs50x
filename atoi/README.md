# [Recursive](#recursive-atoi) [`atoi`](#recursive-atoi)

## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Deepen an understanding of strings
- Practice creating recursive functions

## [Background](#background)

Imagine that you travel back in time to the 1970’s, when the `C`
programming language was first created. You are hired as a programmer to
come up with a way to convert `string`s to `int`s. (You may have used a
function just like this in Week 2, called
[`atoi`](https://manual.cs50.io/3/atoi)). You want to be thorough in
your development process and plan to try several approaches before
deciding on the most efficient.

In this problem, you will start with a simple implementation of `atoi`
that handles positive `int`s using loops. You want to rework this into
an implementation that uses recursion. Recusive functions can be memory
intensive and are not always the best solution, but there are some
problems in which using recursion can provide a simpler and more elegant
solution.

(Scroll to the bottom of this page to see what an implementation of
`atoi` might actually look like.)

- Hints
  - Start by getting the index of the last `char` in the string (the
    `char` before the `\0`).
  - Convert this `char` into its numeric value. Can you subtract some
    `char` to do this?
  - Remove the last `char` from the string by moving the null terminator
    one position to the left.
  - Return this value plus 10 times the integer value of the new
    shortened string.
  - Remember you need a base case when creating a recursive function.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/3/atoi.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `atoi.zip` in
    your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget`
    and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip atoi.zip` to create a folder called `atoi`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute `rm atoi.zip`
    and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

In the recursive version of `convert`, start with the last `char` and
convert it into an integer value. Then shorten the `string`, removing
the last `char`, and then recursively call `convert` using the shortened
string as input, where the next `char` will be processed.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

Why do you need a base case whenever you create a recursive function?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples below.

``` highlight
atoi/ $ ./atoi
Enter a positive integer: 3432
3432
```

``` highlight
atoi/ $ ./atoi
Enter a positive integer: 98765
98765
```

No `check50` for this one!

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the
`$` prompt.

``` highlight
style50 atoi.c
```

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

No need to submit! This is an optional practice problem.

## [A More Thorough Implementation](#a-more-thorough-implementation)

The actual version of `atoi` must handle negative numbers, as well as
leading spaces and non-numeric characters. It might look something like
this:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

// Iterative function to implement `atoi()` function in C
long atoi(const char S[])
{
long num = 0;
int i = 0, sign = 1;

// skip white space characters
while (S[i] == ' ' || S[i] == '\n' || S[i] == '\t') {
i++;
}

// note sign of the number
if (S[i] == '+' || S[i] == '-')
{
if (S[i] == '-') {
sign = -1;
}
i++;
}

// run till the end of the string is reached, or the
// current character is non-numeric
while (S[i] && (S[i] >= '0' && S[i] <= '9'))
{
num = num * 10 + (S[i] - '0');
i++;
}

return sign * num;
}

// Implement `atoi()` function in C
int main(void)
{
char S[] = " -1234567890";

printf("%ld ", atoi(S));

return 0;
}
```
