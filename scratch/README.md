It’s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply,
is to implement in Scratch, at
[scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu), any project of your choice,
be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject
only to the following requirements:

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Your project must use at least two
    sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Your project must have at least three
    scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Your project must use at least one
    conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Your project must use at least one custom
    block that you have made yourself (via **Make a Block**), which must
    take at least one input.
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Your project should be more complex than
    most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though
    instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than
    [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivy’s
    Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).

To meet these requirements, your project should probably use a few dozen
puzzle pieces overall. And your code should ideally be not only correct
but also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit long,
try to break it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something
specific). And try to leverage “abstraction” where possible: if you can
imagine giving a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g.,
**meow**), those could probably be moved to a custom block!

If you’d like some inspiration from past students, here are just a few:

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>[It’s Raining
    Men](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37412/), from lecture
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>[Soccer](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37413/),
    a game
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>[Cookie Love
    Story](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329196/), an animation
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>[Gingerbread
    tales](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277536784/), an interactive
    story
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>[Intersection](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/75390754/),
    a game
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>[Hogwarts](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/422258685),
    a game

You might find these
[tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) or
[starter projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/starter-projects) helpful.
And you’re welcome to explore
[scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all) for
inspiration. But try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out
to implement it. However, don’t try to implement the entirety of your
project all at once: tackle one piece at a time, just as we did in
lecture. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e.,
drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so
forth. And select **File \> Save now** every few minutes so that you
don’t lose any work!
