## [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)

- Practice working with `struct`s
- Practice applying sorting algorithms

## [Background](#background)

We seem to be breaking records every year for the hottest weather ever
recorded. Climate scientists keep track of what are called “new normals”
over multiple years so that we can better predict and prepare for
conditions in the near future. The official normals are calculated for a
uniform 30 year period, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily,
and hourly averages and statistics of temperature, precipitation, and
other climatological variables from almost 15,000 U.S. weather stations.

July is the hottest month of the year for most large US cities. Daytime
temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit regularly occur nearly
everywhere. The exceptions are some cities along the [Pacific
coast](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/us-climate-normals).

In this problem, you will sort the average high temperature values for
10 cities, in decending order.

- Hints
  - When copying one `struct` to another, no need to assign individual
    elements. The entire `struct` can be assigned in one statement.
  - Even though a `void` function cannot return any values, a `return`
    statement can be used to terminate the function.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click inside the terminal window and execute `cd`.
3.  Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/3/temps.zip`
    followed by Enter in order to download a zip called `temps.zip` in
    your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget`
    and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!
4.  Now execute `unzip temps.zip` to create a folder called `temps`.
5.  You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute `rm temps.zip`
    and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt.

## [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)

The `main` function initializes the `temps` array, calls the
`sort_cities` function and prints out the array in sorted order. You
will use an O(n²) sorting algorithm of your choice (possibly bubble
sort, selection sort, or insertion sort) to sort the array by
temperature, in descending order.

## [Thought Question](#thought-question)

- Which of the sorting algorithms did you choose and why?

## [How to Test Your Code](#how-to-test-your-code)

Your program should behave per the examples below.

``` highlight
temps/ $ ./temps

Average July Temperatures by City

Phoenix: 107
Las Vegas: 105
Austin: 97
Miami: 97
Denver: 90
Chicago: 85
New York: 85
Boston: 82
Los Angeles: 82
San Francisco: 66
temps/ $
```

No `check50` for this one!

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the
`$` prompt.

``` highlight
style50 temps.c
```
